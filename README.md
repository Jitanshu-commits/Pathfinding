# Pathfinding
Pathfinding Visualization with Dijkstra's and A* Algorithms
This Python program provides a visual representation of Dijkstra's and A* pathfinding algorithms using the Pygame library. The application allows users to interactively set starting and ending points on a grid, draw obstacles, and visualize the process of finding the shortest path from the starting point to the endpoint while avoiding obstacles.

Features:
Simultaneous Pathfinding: Run Dijkstra's and A* algorithms simultaneously to compare their performance.
User Interaction: Set the starting and ending points by clicking on cells. Draw obstacles by holding the left mouse button.
Algorithm Visualization: See the algorithms in action with real-time visualization. Observe the exploration of cells and the final pathfinding result.
Execution Timing: Measure and display the execution time of Dijkstra's and A* algorithms.
How to Use:
Run the program and interact with the grid using the mouse.
Set the starting and ending points, draw obstacles, and press the space bar to execute Dijkstra's and A* algorithms.
Press 'c' to clear the grid and reset points.
To-Do:
Improve user interface for better clarity and guidance.
Implement more pathfinding algorithms for comparison.
Allow customization of grid size and cell size.
Enhance algorithm visualization with step-by-step details.
Dependencies:
Pygame: Install it using pip install pygame.
Feel free to contribute, report issues, or suggest improvements! Happy pathfinding!

PS: I made alot of similar programs/codes(that don't work/ are bad) feel free to ping me for my previous codes(this is the most polished version of my code and it works! :) 
Thanks!
Limitations: This project uses grid based map tile for pathfinding algorithms to work on which may or may not limit the algorithm's capabilities.(I may change the map tile versions in the future)
